# ECGR-4127-Machine_Learning_for_IoT
Compilation of homeworks and projects from ECGR-4127 Machine Learning for IoT

## Homework 1:
Small python script to refresh coding abilities for the course. 

## Homework 2:
Built 3 CNNs to use on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The first model just had convolutional layers. The second had depthwise separable convolutional layers. The third model added dropout layers to the same structure of the first model. The last model was the best model I could come up with (validation accuracy-wise) with no more than 50,000 parameters. A spreadsheet is included where we performed calculations to find the number of parameters and MACs for each layer in the first two models.
